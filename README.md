# Hamzeh Emreish

Cybersecurity student and full-stack developer based in New York. Currently finishing my CS degree at Lehman College while building security tools and working on web applications.

## About Me

I got into cybersecurity through CTFs and bug bounty hunting, which led me to build tools that automate the tedious parts of security testing. Most of my projects come from solving problems I ran into myself - whether that's automating Burp Suite scans or reverse engineering old game file formats for a modding project.

When I'm not coding, I'm working as a Manager on Duty at Equinox and managing IT infrastructure for a local car wash business.

## What I'm Working On

- **MCP-Kali-Server (Open Source Contribution)** - Contributed to [TriV3's pentesting framework](https://github.com/TriV3/MCP-Kali-Server) by adding 12+ recon tools (Subfinder, Nuclei, Httpx, Arjun, etc.), SSH session management with file transfer capabilities, and reverse shell support. [PR #5 merged](https://github.com/TriV3/MCP-Kali-Server/pull/5)
- **Burp Suite Automation API** - Python extension that exposes Burp Suite functionality through REST endpoints for automated security testing.
- **Security research** - Working through HackTheBox labs and participating in bug bounty programs.
